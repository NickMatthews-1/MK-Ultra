# MK-Ultra
This is my custom made Discord Bot called MK Ultra


This was made using Discord.py.

To get this bot working you need to install Discord from pip by doing

```pip install -U discord```

This bot will not have my token on it so you will need to put your own token onto it to get it working. This currently does support Slash commands as well.
